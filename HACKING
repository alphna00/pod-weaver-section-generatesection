This file describe the rules to use when hacking this project and it
is not meant to be included in the distribution.


* Making changes

Update the Changes file with each commit that includes user-visible
changes.  This saves having to check the file at the time of release.


* Making a release

`dzil' does a lot of things, and we make use of a series of plugins to
automatically handle the Changes file and git.  It may not be clear
what needs to be done, so here's the steps:

1. Make sure the working directory is clean `git status'.

2. Run `dzil test -all'.

3. Edit dist.ini to bump the version number.  Do not commit.  The Git
plugin will make a single commit that bumps the version number in both
`Changes' and `dist.ini'.  It will also automatically make a
lightweight version tag.

4. Run `dzil release'.

5. Run `git push --tags'.
